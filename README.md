# LeetCode-Projects

Welcome to my LeetCode Projects repository!

This is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty and written in C. 

I started learning C in August 2024.

This repository serves as a personal record of my coding journey, problem-solving approaches, and learning progress.

Also, I include main functions in my solutions to test them on my PC before submitting to LeetCode.
